**In a Kubernetes setup, when you access a service using a NodePort, request can be routed to any node in the cluster, regardless of whether the actual pod is running on that node or not. Here’s why:**

**Kubernetes Service Abstraction**
* Kubernetes services, including NodePort, are designed to be cluster-wide abstractions. This means that when you access the service via any node’s IP and the NodePort, Kubernetes can route your request to any pod matching the service selector, regardless of its location.

* The kube-proxy component running on each node is responsible for forwarding requests to the correct pod, even if it’s on a different node.

**Request Forwarding with Kube-Proxy**
* If you access a NodePort on a node without the target pod, kube-proxy will forward the request to a node that has a matching pod running.

* This forwarding happens transparently, so you receive a response even if the target pod isn’t on the node you initially connected to.

**Load Balancing and Round-Robin Routing**
* Kubernetes services perform load balancing across all pods that match the service’s label selector. When you access a NodePort, kube-proxy distributes the request to one of the available pods, balancing the traffic load across the nodes.

* This could result in responses coming from multiple nodes in your cluster if each node is handling different parts of the traffic.

**Example Scenario**
* If nginx is running on Node A but you send a request to Node B or Node C using the NodePort:
* Kube-proxy on Node B or Node C will forward your request to the nginx pod on Node A.The response will be forwarded back to you, and it might appear to come from Node B or Node C due to the kube-proxy routing.
